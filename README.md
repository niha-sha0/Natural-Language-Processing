# **Natural Language Processing :**                                                                                                                                                                      
###### Natural Language Processing is a subfield of linguistic (human languages), computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amount of natural language data.
                  
## Need for NLP :                                                                                                                                                
###### In neuropsychology, linguistics (human languages) and the philosophy of language, a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repitition without humans consious planning or premeditaion. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing. They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or to study logic.

## Real World Application of NLP :
- #### Contextual Advertisements :                                     
###### For example : Like I use instagram and I likes to search about technology and companies so, they show me the advertisement based on my interests by knowing it through my activities on instagram which is called as targeted advertisements.                                                            
+ #### Email Clients :                                  
###### Email filters are one of the most basic and initial applications of NLP online. It started out with spam filters, uncovering certain words or phrases that signal a spam message. But filtering has upgraded, just like early adaptations of NLP. One of the more prevalent, newer applications of NLP is found in Gmail's email classification. The system recognizes if emails belong in one of three categories (primary, social, or promotions) based on their contents.
* #### Social Media : 
###### Social media monitoring uses NLP to filter the overwhelming number of comments and queries that companies might receive under a given post, or even across all social channels. These monitoring tools leverage the previously discussed sentiment analysis and spot emotions like irritation, frustration, happiness, or satisfaction. The tools will notify you of any patterns and trends, for example, a glowing review, which would be a positive sentiment that can be used as a customer testimonial.
- #### Search Engines :                 
###### Search engines use NLP to surface relevant results based on similar search behaviors or user intent so the average person finds what they need without being a search-term wizard. For example, Google not only predicts what popular searches may apply to your query as you start typing, but it looks at the whole picture and recognizes what youâ€™re trying to say rather than the exact search words.
+ #### Language Translation :
###### One of the most common NLP examples is translation. In the 1950s, Georgetown and IBM presented the first NLP-based translation machine, which had the ability to translate 60 Russian sentences to English automatically. Translation applications available today use NLP and Machine Learning to accurately translate both text and voice formats for most global languages.

## Common NLP Tasks :
- ######      Text / Document Classification
+ ###### Sentiment Analysis               
* ###### Information Retrieval
- ######   Parts of Speech Tagging
+ ###### Language Detection And Machine Translation
* ###### Conversational Agents - Text & Speech based
- ###### Knowledge Graph and Question Answer Systems
+ ###### Text Summarization
* ###### Topic Modelling
- ###### Text Generation
+ ###### Spell Checking and Grammar Correction
* ###### Text Parsing
- ###### Speech to Text

## Approaches to NLP :
- ##### Heuristic Methods: 
###### A heuristic technique is any approach to problem solving or self discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranted to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but it neverthless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. 
###### Examples : Regular Expressions, Wordnet, Open Mind Common Sense                                                                                                                                          
###### Advantage : These are quick approaches and accurate (chances of errors are less).                                                               
###### Current Scenario :  Yes, Heuristic Approaches are used in current time.
+ ##### Machine Learning based Methods:
###### Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing are important subfields of Artificial Intelligence that have gained great impact in recent times. In Machine Learning, as we work with different kind of data, we also work with textual data through Machine Learning Algorithms.
###### Advantage : In Heuristic, we can make rules but there is some open ended problems where the human being doesn't have the ability to make rules. In that type of problem, Machine Learning approaches are used because algorithm internally made rules in Machine Learning Algorithms. 
###### The relationship between data has been made based on input and output.
###### Machine Learning is used to solve open ended problems. and it became go to approach to solve Natural Language Processing problem.
###### Currently, Heuristic Approaches are also used but Machine Learning approaches are more powerful and used in wide variety.
###### Machine Learning WorkFlow : Convert textual data to numbers and then give number to machine learning algorithm and the output of machine learning algorithm is been evaluated.

##### Algorithms Used :-
+ ###### Naive Bayes 
- ###### Logistic Regression
* ###### SVM (Support Vector Machine)
+ ###### LDA
- ###### Hidden Markov Models
* ##### Deep Learning based Methods: Deep Learning advantage over Machine Learning
+ ###### In Machine Learning, we convert textual data to number and the sequential information of text has loose which means, they don't care about the sequential information of data. But Deep Learning based models they also care about the sequential information of text.
- ###### Feature generation is automatically done by deep learning model whereas in Machine Learning we will have to made them by ourself based on our understanding.

###### Architecutes Used :
+ ###### RNN
- ###### LSTM
* ###### GRU / CNN
+ ###### Transformers - 2015
- ###### Autoencoders
# **Challenges in Natural Language Processing :**
+ ###### Ambiguity
- ###### Contextual Words
* ###### Colloquialisms and Slang
+ ###### Synonyms
- ###### Irony, Sarcasm and Tonal Differnce
* ###### Creativity
+ ###### Diversity
* ###### Spelling Errors
